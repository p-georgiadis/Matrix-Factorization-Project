The RMSE of the predicted ratings using sklearn's Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is > 2.

#### Limitations of sklearn's NMF

1. **Scalability**: NMF may not scale well with very large datasets due to its computational complexity. For a large number of users and items, the training time can be significant.
2. **Sparsity Handling**: NMF in sklearn does not inherently handle the sparsity of the user-item matrix well. Real-world recommendation systems often deal with sparse matrices where most of the entries are missing. Techniques like alternating least squares (ALS) in collaborative filtering handle sparsity more effectively.
3. **Overfitting**: Without proper regularization, NMF can overfit the training data, especially when the number of components is large. This can result in poor generalization to unseen data.
4. **Baseline Comparison**: Compared to simple baseline methods like mean imputation or similarity-based methods (e.g., user-user or item-item collaborative filtering), NMF may not always provide superior results. Baseline methods are often computationally cheaper and easier to implement.

#### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Regularization**: Implementing regularization within the NMF algorithm could help prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
2. **Hybrid Approaches**: Combining NMF with other recommendation techniques (e.g., content-based filtering or collaborative filtering) might yield better performance.
3. **Advanced Models**: Using advanced matrix factorization techniques such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or incorporating deep learning models can improve accuracy.
4. **Parameter Tuning**: Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., number of components, regularization parameters) through grid search or random search can help find the optimal settings for the model.
