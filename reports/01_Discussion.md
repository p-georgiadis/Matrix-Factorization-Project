### Discussion

#### Comparison of Supervised and Unsupervised Approaches

In this project, we implemented both supervised and unsupervised learning approaches to classify news articles into various categories. The supervised approach utilized labeled data to train models, whereas the unsupervised approach discovered topics without using labels.

#### Supervised Approach

The supervised approach involved two primary models:
1. **NMF + Logistic Regression**: This model achieved an accuracy of **0.9629** on the test data. The precision, recall, and f1-score for each category were consistently high, indicating robust performance across all categories.
2. **TF-IDF + Logistic Regression**: This model performed slightly better with an accuracy of **0.9798** on the test data. This higher accuracy suggests that directly using TF-IDF features with a logistic regression classifier was more effective than using NMF for dimensionality reduction before classification.

These results demonstrate that the supervised approach, with sufficient labeled data, can achieve very high accuracy and reliability. The high precision and recall values also indicate that the models generalize well and are less prone to overfitting.

#### Unsupervised Approach

The unsupervised approach involved using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to discover latent topics in the articles. The train accuracy for different numbers of components (topics) was recorded as follows:

| n_components | train_accuracy |
|--------------|----------------|
| 5            | 0.905660       |
| 10           | 0.927898       |
| 20           | 0.883423       |
| 30           | 0.872642       |
| 40           | 0.877358       |
| 50           | 0.843666       |

The best accuracy achieved was **0.9279** with 10 components. However, the performance declined as the number of components increased beyond this point. This indicates that while NMF can effectively discover topics, it does not always translate to the best classification performance, especially compared to supervised methods.

#### Data Efficiency

To evaluate data efficiency, we can consider reducing the training data size for the supervised models and observe the performance changes:
1. **10% of Labels**: Supervised models typically experience a significant drop in performance with only 10% of labels due to insufficient training data.
2. **20% of Labels**: With 20% of labels, the models perform better but still not as well as with the full dataset.
3. **50% of Labels**: At 50% of labels, supervised models start to perform reasonably well, though not as accurately as with the full dataset.

In contrast, unsupervised methods like NMF do not rely on labeled data for training. They can still discover useful latent structures in the data, making them useful in scenarios where labeled data is scarce. However, they may not achieve the same level of accuracy as supervised methods.

#### Overfitting

**Supervised Methods**: With a large amount of labeled data, supervised methods are less prone to overfitting, especially with regularization techniques and cross-validation. However, with limited data, these models might overfit the training data, leading to poor generalization on the test set.

**Unsupervised Methods**: Unsupervised methods like NMF are less likely to overfit because they do not use labels and instead focus on capturing the underlying structure of the data. However, they may still capture noise as part of the latent features, which can affect performance.

#### Conclusion

- **Supervised Learning**: Highly effective with sufficient labeled data, achieving higher accuracy and better generalization. The TF-IDF + Logistic Regression model performed the best in this comparison.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Useful for discovering latent topics, especially when labeled data is limited. The performance can be improved by fine-tuning the number of components and other hyperparameters.

In summary, supervised methods are more data-efficient and achieve higher accuracy with sufficient labels. Unsupervised methods, while not as accurate, provide valuable insights and can be a good alternative when labeled data is scarce. Balancing both approaches could leverage the strengths of each method, potentially improving the overall performance and robustness of the model.
