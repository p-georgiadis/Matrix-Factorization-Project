young catholic join ira administrative detention muslim could similar effect surely public would better protected security service rather alerting suspect terrorist placing house arrest long place suspect terrorist surveillance maybe acquire sufficient evidence prosecute even better prevent terrorist attack usually much time mr forsyth largely right wing view time got spot doubt terrorist
